## About

The purpose of this project is to study emergent competitive strategies between agents controlled by autonomous [Deep Recurrent Q-Networks]() (DRQN). More particularly, the investigation will be carried out within a custom-built environment where two agents, a "Seeker" and a "Hider", will play a simplified version of the pursuit-evasion game.
